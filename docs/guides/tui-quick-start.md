2. Look at **very bottom** of screen

4. Wait 1 second - numbers should update

**If you don't see it**:
- Make sure your terminal is tall enough
- The status bar is ABOVE the footer (the line with "1 Overview  2 Agents  ...")

---

### Test 2: Command Palette
1. Press `Ctrl+P` (hold Control and press P)
2. A dialog should pop up in the center
3. Type "agent"
4. Should see "Show Agents" highlighted
5. Press Enter - should go to Agents view
6. Try again with different searches

**If it doesn't open**:
- Make sure you're pressing Ctrl+P together
- Some terminals might need Ctrl+Shift+P

---

### Test 3: Dashboard

2. The memory and CPU values should change
3. They update automatically every second

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Status bar is empty or shows no metrics
**Cause**: psutil not installed
**Fix**: Already fixed! Just restart the TUI

### Command palette doesn't open with Ctrl+P
**Possible causes**:
1. Terminal is intercepting Ctrl+P
2. Try in a different terminal
3. Check if textual keybindings are working (try other keys like 1-9, A, C, R, Q)

### Dashboard looks plain (no colors/icons)
**Cause**: Terminal doesn't support Unicode or colors
**Fix**: Use a modern terminal (iTerm2, Terminal.app, Windows Terminal, etc.)

### "Module not found" errors
**Fix**: Reinstall the package:
```bash
uv pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```
